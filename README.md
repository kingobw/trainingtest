# Hello!
No one is perfect. I, FE King, need to edit this file on my-branch.

This is my second (well first for lesson) exercise creating a repo.

I will add more information here as time goes on. 

In this file, I will learn markdown. I will learn it by:

* Practicing
* Trial and error
* Copying examples and seeing their output.

I will use [this reference](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) as a guide.

One day **soon** I will be a markdown master.
